Hello fellow nerds!

Congrats on making it this far in my tutorial!

Be sure to put all of these files in the /var/www directory of your raspberry pi! (outside of the folder you downloaded it in)

Thanks for watching my YouTube video!

This is the website which will allow you to access your lights/outlets/electronics from anywhere in the house!

I am keeping it simple to allow for easy customization and simple implementation (relatively simple that is). So to make
things a little easier on you guys, I made a file called Config. Go into there if you would like to change the header/color scheme/button size of your website.


For questions or concerns, contact me at any time through my YouTube channel notsoaveragenerd@gmail.com !

ENJOY!
